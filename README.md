# BlackJack Game with Sinatra #

Builds the procedural BlackJack game from previous repos into a format that can
be served through the browser instead of on the command line. 

Features:
    1. Uses Twitter Bootstrap for GUI

Drawbacks: 
    1. It's slower than an old turtle crawling through cold molasses.
    2. It assumes that all data entered is already valid.

Running the script
1. Make sure the 'sinatra' gem is installed.
2. From the command line, you can start the server by 'ruby main.rb -p $PORT -o $IP' (http://simoncurd.com/2012/11/16/running-ruby-sinatra-on-cloud-9/)
3. If you have the 'shotgun' gem installed, you can instead run 'shotgun main.rb'
4. ctrl+c to stop the server
