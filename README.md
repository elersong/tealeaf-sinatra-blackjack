# BlackJack Game with Sinatra #

Builds the procedural BlackJack game from previous repos into a format that can
be served through the browser instead of on the command line. 

Serious Drawback: It's slower than an old turtle crawling through cold molasses.

1. Make sure the 'sinatra' gem is installed.
2. From the command line, you can start the server by 'ruby main.rb -p $PORT -o $IP' (http://simoncurd.com/2012/11/16/running-ruby-sinatra-on-cloud-9/)
3. If you have the 'shotgun' gem installed, you can instead run 'shotgun main.rb'
4. ctrl+c to stop the server
